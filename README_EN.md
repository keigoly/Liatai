## ◇ Overview

Check "What's happening now?" instantly without stopping your work.
The ultimate tool for staying updated and monitoring trends, bringing real-time search to your Chrome side panel.

"Liatai" allows you to view real-time search results (X/Twitter trends and posts) in the side panel without switching browser tabs. While watching videos, reading articles, or working... you can follow the world's reactions in real-time "on the side" of any task.

## 【Core Features】

### 1. Unobtrusive "Side Panel" Display
No need to open a new tab to search. It appears smoothly on the side of your browser, allowing you to "watch" trending topics and keyword excitement without interrupting your main work.

### 2. Comprehensive "Auto-Refresh" Customization
Equipped with auto-refresh features so you don't miss the latest info. Refresh intervals can be finely tuned to suit your needs.

* **Trend Refresh**: 1 min / 3 min / 5 min / 10 min
* **Search Results Refresh**: 1 sec / 3 sec / 5 sec / 10 sec
  * (*Ultra-fast second-level updates ensure you don't miss the flow of live commentary*)

### 3. Powerful "NG Filter" Function
Block unwanted information before it enters your view. Create a comfortable timeline.

* **NG Words**: Hide posts containing specific words.
* **NG Users**: Hide posts from specific user IDs (@...).
* **Regex Support**: Advanced filtering using regular expressions is supported for power users.

### 4. 🌐 Multi-language Support (NEW!)
Switch between Japanese and English from the settings screen. The UI will optionally be displayed in your preferred language.

### 5. 🪟 Popup Window (NEW!)
Switch from the side panel to a popup window. Display it in an independent window to freely customize your workspace.

* **Font Size**: Adjustable in 5 stages from 13px to 18px for best readability.

## ◇ From the Developer

I developed this because "it's troublesome to open a search screen every time" and "I want to watch TV commentary comfortably on my PC".
We always welcome bug reports and feature requests via the link in the settings screen.
